Main script to get the app up and running is 'npm start'.

Unfortunately the provided Endpoint API has been out of reach so i had to replace it with another fake API and because of filter situation we all have encountered  , YOU NEED TO HAVE TURNED ON VPN before running it on localhost or else the ui/ux would be incomplete .

This project was initialy finished within 2.5 to 3 days .

many more features could be added such as  NEXTjs , Tailwind css and also libraries and components and use of different hooks whether customized or already stored. 

In case of any problems arising while working with the file :

kind regards.
